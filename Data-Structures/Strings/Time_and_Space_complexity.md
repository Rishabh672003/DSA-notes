- Reversing:
    - Time Complexity: O(n) - we need to visit each character in the string once to reverse it. Therefore, the time complexity of reversing a string is O(n)
    - Space Complexity: O(n) - in order to reverse a string, we need to allocate a new string of the same length as the original string. Therefore, the space complexity of reversing a string is also O(n).

- Sorting:
    - Time Complexity: O(n log n) - most sorting algorithms take O(n log n) time for strings as well as for arrays. Examples of such algorithms are merge sort, quicksort, and heapsort.
    - Space Complexity: O(n) - some sorting algorithms require extra memory for temporary storage of data, while others can be implemented in-place. Therefore, the space complexity of sorting a string can vary depending on the algorithm used.

- Trim:
    - Time Complexity: O(n) - we need to visit each character in the string once to trim it. Therefore, the time complexity of trimming a string is O(n).
    - Space Complexity: O(n) - in order to trim a string, we need to allocate a new string of the same or smaller length as the original string. Therefore, the space complexity of trimming a string is also O(n).

- Finding Length:
    - Time Complexity: O(1) - most programming languages provide a built-in function to find the length of a string. This function takes constant time as it simply returns the length of the string.
    - Space Complexity: O(1) - finding the length of a string does not require any additional memory allocation. It can be done in place.

- Searching:
    - Time Complexity: O(n) - in the worst case scenario, we may need to visit each character in the string to find the desired character or substring. This takes O(n) time.
    - Space Complexity: O(1) - searching for a character or substring in a string does not require any additional memory allocation. It can be done in place.

- Creating a Substring:
    - Time Complexity: O(m) - where m is the length of the substring. Creating a substring requires visiting each character in the substring, which takes O(m) time.
    - Space Complexity: O(m) - in order to create a substring, we need to allocate a new string of length m. Therefore, the space complexity of creating a substring is O(m).

- Palindrome:
    - Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
    - Space complexity: O(n) - We create a new string that contains only the alphabetic characters from the input string, which has the same length as the input string.

- Anagram:
    - Time complexity: O(n log n), where n is the length of the string.
    - Space complexity: O(n) - We create new strings that contain only the alphabetic characters from the input strings, which have the same length as the input strings. We also need to allocate memory for the sorted strings, which also have length n.

**Note**: It's worth noting that the time and space complexities mentioned here are for the basic implementation of these operations. The actual complexities can vary based on the specific implementation and the data being processed.
