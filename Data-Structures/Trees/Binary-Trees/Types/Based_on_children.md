# Types of Binary Trees Based on Number of Children

## 1. Complete Binary Tree

A **complete binary tree** is a binary tree in which all levels are completely filled except possibly for the last level, which is filled from left to right. It means that every level of the tree, except possibly the last one, is completely filled with nodes, and all nodes are as left as possible.

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \ 
    D   E
```

## 2. Perfect Binary Tree

A **perfect binary tree** is a binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level. In other words, it is a full binary tree in which all levels are completely filled.

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \ / \
    D  E F  G
```

## 3. Balanced Binary Tree

A **balanced binary tree**, also known as a **height-balanced binary tree**, is a binary tree in which the depth (height) of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by at most 1. In other words, the tree is balanced such that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is not greater than 1.

```
        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \ 
    D   E
   /     \
  F       G
```
